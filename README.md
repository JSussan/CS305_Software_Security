# Artemis-Financial
Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment Report

# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
The client is Artemis Financial, who is a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance for their patrons. Artemis Financial wants to implement and apply the most current and effective software security. They have a public web interface and are seeking my expertise in taking steps to protect their client data and financial information.

# What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
I was able to correctly identify and implement the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm cipher. I chose to use the AES 128-bit key length as I felt that overall it provides very strong secuirty and performance. It is important for Artemis Financial to keep sensative data secure and build trust in their clients.

# What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
I found it challenging to create a local environment that is secured via a self-signed certificate. Since this was new to me, it took a lot of trial and error before I was able to complete this task.

# How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
I refactored the given code to increase code quality and addressed the API (Application Programming Interface), cryptography, and client/server interaction. I was also able to complete a checksum verification and suppressed false positives and vulnerabilities that currently do not have a solution.

# How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I used a secondary static testing of the refactored code using the dependency check tool to ensure code complies with software security enhancements.

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I used a dependency check report to see what vulnerabilities were present in the code.

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
I know have the ability and a better understanding of how to generate security certificates, as well as how to check for vulnerabilities in code. How to suppress false positives and vulnerabilties that have no current solution. I also have a better understanding of how algorithm ciphers work and how to implement them.
